You are a lone robot in a post-apocalyptic world, defending the last nuclear reactor from alien invaders to save humanity's last survivors.
This game is a 2D Side Scrolling Shooter, where the player is tasked with reaching the final area and defeating a boss.
The player is given the opportunity to pick up various weapons while travelling to the final area.
